   <h1 style=margin-left:20px;">About Me</h1>
  
  <p class="double"> You can find me sleeping soundly with the door wide open or irritably singing the "over it overtures" to my life in perfect harmony.<br> 
        I tried to run away from home 6 times then realized that it was completely futile because everywhere I go, they welcome me with open arms.<br>
Until I learn how to perfectly marinade a portabello mushroom, I will continue to eat meat.<br> 
        I fell in love with 3 of the biggest assholes a person could ever meet in the span of 5 years. They are my nephews- 6 yrs, 2yrs and 2 months old.<br>
